### Description
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning models are loosely related to information processing and communication patterns in a biological nervous system, such as neural coding that attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain.

The  code is written from scratch using pytorch for dataloading and GPU acceleration.

### Algorithms used;
1. Gradient Descent
2. Gradient Descent with Momentum
3. Gradient Descent with RMSprop
4. Gradient Descent with Adam
5. Learning rate decay
