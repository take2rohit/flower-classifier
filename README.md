# <u> Binary classification using Logistic Regression model</u>

### Aim
It classifies whether a given image is of Sunflower or of rose using different Deep Learning algorithms

### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Technical Details
1. Model Used: *Logistic Regression*
2. Training Dataset Size: *1300*
3. Test Dataset Size: *90*
4. Library used: *Pytorch, MatPlotLib, TorchVision,Random*
5. Initial learning rate: *0.01*
6. No. of epochs: *100*
7. Mini batch size: *64*

### Description
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning models are loosely related to information processing and communication patterns in a biological nervous system, such as neural coding that attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain.

The  code is written from scratch using pytorch for dataloading, matrix calculations and GPU acceleration.

### Algorithms used;
1. Gradient Descent (Batch, Mini-batch, Stochastic)
2. Gradient Descent with Momentum
3. Learning rate decay
